## Mario Vázquez Pérez 🙋‍♂️

I'm a Computer Engineering degree student in Univertity of Vigo. I'm also working at [Balidea](https://www.balidea.com/) as a Junior Web Developer.
Since I love this field, I'm part of [Auria Technologies](https://auria.gal/), a non-profit organization focused on programming a driverless car to participate in formula student competitions. 

My main programming languages and platforms are: Java, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C++, C# and Struts2.
